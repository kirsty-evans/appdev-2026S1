# Linear Interpolation

You have been tasked with writing a static method that will calculate a value between two points with an interpilated value.

Example:

Given start at 1 and end at 4 with an interpolated point being 0.5 between 1 and 4,
the returned value woudl be `2.5`.

Make sure you implement the following method.

```
public static float LinearInterpolation(int start, int end, float interp)
```


## Running the tests

You can check your implementation against the unit tests by running `dotnet test`.
