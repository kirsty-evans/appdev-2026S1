# Your Grade

You are required to construct a program that will
compute your current grade given the mark you have received
from your semester.

You are to read the mark from input and your program must output
what grade that mark corresponds to.

* Given a mark of 85 or above, your program should output A
* Given a mark of 75 or above, your program should output B
* Given a mark of 65 or above, your program should output C
* Given a mark of 50 or above, your program should output D
* Given a mark below 50, your program should output F.

Example of usage 1:

```
Enter your mark: 60
D   
```

Example of usage 2:

```
Enter your mark: 90
A   
```

Example of usage 3:

```
Enter your mark: 40
F
```

## How to test your program

You can test your program by running `dotnet test` against a suite of test cases.
