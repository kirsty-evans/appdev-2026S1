# Count Vowels

You tasked with writing a program that will count the vowels of a string.

```
public static int[] Count(string line)
```

The above method, requires the implementation to return an array which maps each
vowel to the following index.

* [0] -> 'a'
* [1] -> 'e'
* [2] -> 'i'
* [3] -> 'o'
* [4] -> 'u'

You will need to handle both uppercase and lowercase characters from a string.

## How to test?

Use the `dotnet test` command to run the test cases within CountVowels.Test.
