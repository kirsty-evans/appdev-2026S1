# Word Searcher

A common problem within programming is searching and it is best you get familiar with
implementing solutions to these problems. You have been tasked with implementing two
methods.

* `string? Find(string[] words, string word)`

The `Find` method will search for a word within the array `words` and return it
if it is found. Otherwise, it will return null.

* `int? FindIndex(string[] words, string word`
Similar to `Find`, it will search for the word within the array `words` but will
return the index that it is located at.

You will need to implement these methods within the `WordSearcher.cs` file which
contains the `WordSearcher` class.

## How to run tests?

To run the test cases, use `dotnet test` to execute the test cases and validate your
implementation.
