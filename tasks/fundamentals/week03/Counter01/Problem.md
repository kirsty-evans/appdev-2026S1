# Counter Object

You have been tasked with writing a class that will increment an integer that it maintains and be able to retrieve it upon request. This class is called `Counter` and it will have the following methods and constructors.


* `Counter()` - Basic constructor, just starts at 0.

* `Counter(int start)` - Overloaded constructor, will make the starting point `start`.

* `void Forward()` - Will increment the value of the counter.

* `void Backward()` - Will decrement the value of the counter.

* `int Get()` - Gets the current value of the counter.

* `void Reset()` - Resets the counter to its original starting value.

## How to test

You can test your solution with `dotnet test`.
