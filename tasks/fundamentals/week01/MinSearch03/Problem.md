You have been tasked with writing a static method that will find the smallest
number in an array. You will need to implement the following:


```
public static int? Find(int[] numbers)
```

The `int?` can seem a little confusing, but simply put this is indicating that
if the array does not contain any elements, it would be able to to find the
smallest number within the array, therefore a `null` will need to be returned.

Implement this function and test it against the set of test cases bundled.



## How to run tests?

You can run the set of test cases against your solution using `dotnet test`
in the command line. Alternatively, you can load this with Visual Studio and
run the test project.
