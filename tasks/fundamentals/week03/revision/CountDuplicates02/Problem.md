You are tasked with writing a method that will count the number of elements that contain a duplicate entry. In the event that null is passed your method should return 0. Be aware of overcounting.

```
static int CountDuplicates(int[] a)
```

Example:

```
int[] dups = {1, 1, 5, 6, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2, 8};

int result = CountDuplicates(dups); //3
```


## Running tests

You can run your tests using `dotnet test` from the solution root or using `Run Tests` from visual studio.
